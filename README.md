# Torch NBody

Experiment in using PyTorch to vectorize NBody simulation. Simple derivative methods. GPU is 30x faster than CPU on my machine. I wonder how a hand-tuned kernel would perform.

#### Run
Make sure [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) is installed.
```
> pip install glfw pyopengl numpy
> ./cudasim.py
```
